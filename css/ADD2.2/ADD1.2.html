        <p align="center">Hi All!Lets explore a bit following HTML tags you might not use much in the future but definitely need to know them.
            So press the icon below to see the definition and usage.
        </p>

        <p>The &#60;dd&#62; tag defines a description list.<br> 
            The &#60;dl&#62; tag is used in conjunction with &#60;dt&#62; (defines terms/names) and &#60;dd&#62; (describes each term/name).</p>
        <p>expample:<br>
            &#60;dl&#62;<br>
                &#60;dt&#62;Coffee&#60;/dt&#62;<br>
                &#60;dd&#62;Black hot drink&#60;/dd&#62;<br>
                &#60;dt&#62;Milk&#60;dt&#62;<br>
                &#60;dd&#62;White cold drink&#60;/dd&#62;<br>
            &#60;/dl&#62;
        </p>

        <p>The &#60;pre&#62; tag defines preformatted text. Text in a &#60;pre&#62; element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.</p>
        <p>&#60;pre&#62;<br>
            Text in a pre element<br>
            is displayed in a fixed-width<br>
            font, and it preserves<br>
            both      spaces and<br>
            line breaks<br>
            &#60;/pre&#62;</p>

        <p>The &#60;tt&#62; HTML Tag represents inline text that is shown with the user agent's default monospace font face This element was designed to render text as it would appear on a fixed-width display, such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.</p>

        <p>The &#60;kbd&#62; tag is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.</p>
